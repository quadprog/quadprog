    """Solve a strictly convex quadratic program

    Minimize     1/2 x^T G x - a^T x
    Subject to   C.T x >= b

    This routine uses the the Goldfarb/Idnani dual algorithm [1].

    References

    ... [1] D. Goldfarb and A. Idnani (1983). A numerically stable dual
        method for solving strictly convex quadratic programs.
        Mathematical Programming, 27, 1-33.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : array, shape=(n, n)
        matrix appearing in the quadratic function to be minimized
    a : array, shape=(n,)
        vector appearing in the quadratic function to be minimized
    C : array, shape=(n, m)
        matrix defining the constraints under which we want to minimize the
        quadratic function
    b : array, shape=(m), default=None
        vector defining the constraints
    meq : int, default=0
        the first meq constraints are treated as equality constraints,
        all further as inequality constraints (defaults to 0).
    factorized : bool, default=False
        If True, then we are passing :math:`R^{âˆ’1}` (where :math:`G = R^T R`)
        instead of the matrix G in the argument G.

    Returns
    -------
    x : array, shape=(n,)
        vector containing the solution of the quadratic programming problem.
    f : float
        the value of the quadratic function at the solution.
    xu : array, shape=(n,)
        vector containing the unconstrained minimizer of the quadratic function
    iterations : tuple
        2-tuple. the first component contains the number of iterations the
        algorithm needed, the second indicates how often constraints became
        inactive after becoming active first.
    lagrangian : array, shape=(m,)
        vector with the Lagragian at the solution.
    iact : array
        vector with the indices of the active constraints at the solution.
